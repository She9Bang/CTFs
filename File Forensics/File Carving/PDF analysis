1- run pdf-parser to get a summary about what the pdf contains
  pdf-parser --stats file.pdf 
If in the output we hvae something like " /Embeddedfile 1: 3"
it means there's exactly 1 Embeddedfile inside, with an object id of 3

2-Extract the embedded file :
  pdf-parser --object 3 --raw --filter file.pdf > out
Print the extracted file 
  cat out
If it's some base-64 encoded string, decode it and put the output on another file:
  base64 -di  out > out2
Now check the type of the file
  File out2
If it's a JPEG for exemple
  mv out2 out3.jpeg
